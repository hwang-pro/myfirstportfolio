Hello! I am Hwang Kyeong Jae, currently studying Industrial Information Systems Engineering at Jeonbuk National University. 
I have chosen Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence as my double major. I am interested in information security, and I have a particular interest in web hacking and am studying hard in this field.

At Jeonbuk National University, I am conducting various projects and research related to information security, acquiring practical security skills through CTF competitions and wargames.
